/**
 * Find the number of operations required to make all array elements Equal Given
 * an array of N integers, the task is to find the number of operations required
 * to make all elements in the array equal. In one operation we can distribute
 * equal weights from the maximum element to the rest of the array elements. If
 * it is not possible to make the array elements equal after performing the
 * above operations then print -1.<br>
 * Examples:<br>
 * 
 * Input: arr = [1, 6, 1, 1, 1];<br>
 * Output: 4<br>
 * Explanation: Since arr becomes [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] after distribution from max
 * element.<br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * Input : arr = [2, 2, 3];<br>
 * Output : -1<br>
 * Explanation: Here arr becomes [3, 3, 1] after distribution.
